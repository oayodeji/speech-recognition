# Voice Assistant - Simple Speech Recognition

Welcome to the Simple Speech Recognition repository. This project provides a straightforward implementation of a voice assistant, similar to Siri but called Jarvis, that uses speech recognition to perform commands.

## Overview

Voice assistants have become an integral part of our daily lives, helping us perform tasks hands-free, provide information quickly, and offer accessible solutions for those unable to use traditional input methods. This project offers a simple yet effective introduction to this technology, giving you a peek under the hood of modern voice assistants.

## Prerequisites
